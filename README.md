# Neural Network from Scratch
 
A from-scratch implementation of a neural network using only NumPy, to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
Special thanks to Samson Zhang on YouTube, for providing the basis for this implementation.

## Features

- Pure NumPy implementation
- 2-layer neural network with customizable layer sizes
- Mini-batch gradient descent for efficient training

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository on your local machine.
2. Open and run the first cell of the `Neural Network.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to install the required dependencies, and then run the second cell to execute the complete pipeline.
